# ðŸ”¶Problem Statement.

- AtliQ Mart is a growing FMCG manufacturer headquartered in Gujarat, India. It is currently operational in three cities ***Surat, Ahmedabad and Vadodra***. They want to expand to other metro/tier1 cities in the next Few years.
<br>

 
- AtliQ Mart is currently facing a problem where a few ***" key customers did not extend the annual contract*** due to service issues".
	- It is speculated that some of the essential products were either "not delivered on time" or "not delivered in Full Quantity" over a continued period, which could have resulted in bad customer service.

	- Management wants to fix this issue before expanding to other cities and requested their ***supply chain analytics team*** to track the â€˜On timeâ€™ and â€˜In Fullâ€™ delivery service level for all the customers on a daily basis so that they can respond swiftly to these issues.<br>
  
<br>

- The Supply Chain team decided to use a standard approach to measure the service level in which they will measure â€˜on-time delivery (OT) %â€™, â€˜In-full quantity delivery (IF) %â€™ and OnTime in full quantity (OTIF) % of the customer orders on a daily basis against the target service level set for each customer.
