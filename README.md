# Problem Statement.

- AtliQ Mart is a growing FMCG manufacturer headquartered in Gujarat, India. It is currently operational in three cities ***Surat, Ahmedabad and Vadodra***. They want to expand to other metro/tier1 cities in the next Few years.
<br>

 
- AtliQ Mart is currently facing a problem where a few ***" key customers did not extend the annual contract*** due to service issues".
	- It is speculated that some of the essential products were either "not delivered on time" or "not delivered in Full Quantity" over a continued period, which could have resulted in bad customer service.

	- Management wants to fix this issue before expanding to other cities and requested their ***supply chain analytics team*** to track the ‘On time’ and ‘In Full’ delivery service level for all the customers on a daily basis so that they can respond swiftly to these issues.<br>
  
<br>

- The Supply Chain team decided to use a standard approach to measure the service level in which they will measure ‘on-time delivery (OT) %’, ‘In-full quantity delivery (IF) %’ and OnTime in full quantity (OTIF) % of the customer orders on a daily basis against the target service level set for each customer.

  # Task.
- Create the metrics according to the metrics list.
- Create a dashboard according to the requirements provided by stakeholders in the business review meeting. You will be provided with the transcript of this 
  business review meeting in comic form.
- Create relevant insights not provided in the metric list/stakeholder meeting.

# My Approach
- I utilized a star schema model to structure the data and performed data transformations with Power Query. 
- Leveraging DAX, I developed custom measures and calculated columns to enhance data insights.
- To ensure ease of use and interactivity, I designed a user-friendly dashboard with bookmarks for smooth navigation, consistently applying an orange-black color palette to align with the company’s branding.
-  Additionally, I optimized visuals and filters for clarity, enabling end users to interact effectively with the data and derive insights effortlessly.
